         <p>My <em>hope</em> from this class is to learn the basics of coding a website to be able to create the basic structure for one. I also <em>hope</em> that I can become more comfortanle using coding and web design terms to be able to explain how the process works to others. I also <em>hope</em> to have a good understanding of the terms to be able to confidently say these terms in general</p>
